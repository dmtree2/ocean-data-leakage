To understand why I went with "baking the keyword config files into the Docker image" consider this passage from Viktor Farcic's book:

> If we were to start developing a new application today, it would be, among other things, distributed, scalable, stateless, and fault tolerant. Those are some of todayâ€™s needs. While we might question how many of us know how to design an application with those quality attributes in mind, hardly anyone would argue against having any of them. What is often forgotten is the configuration. Which mechanism should your new application use to configure itself? How about environment variables?
>
>> Environment variables fit well into distributed systems. They are easy to define, and they are portable. They are the ideal choice for configuration mechanism of new applications.
>
> However, in some cases, the configuration might be too complex for environment variables. In such situations, we might need to fall back to files (hopefully YAML). When those cases are combined with legacy applications which are almost exclusively using file-based configuration, it is evident that we cannot rely only on environment variables.
>
> When a configuration is based on files, the best approach we can take is to bake the configuration into a Docker image. That way, we are going down the fully-immutable road. Still, that might not be possible when our application needs different configuration options for various clusters (e.g., testing and production).
